# DeepSeek Harness — Windows x64

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [English](README.md) | [平台差异 / Platform details](docs/PLATFORM.md)

This repository targets **Windows x64 / x64 runtimes**: 18 additional plugin entries, 11 top-level choices, 68 feature descriptions and 1 local source package(s). Built-in host code is excluded, with upstream ownership/links/licenses retained.

**Platform adaptation is not complete feature certification.** Before applying an install, the installer checks OS/Python architecture and, when fetching, Node architecture. Mismatches are refused before filesystem mutation. External accounts, browsers, phones and Desktop UI still require target-machine validation.

The Windows target is x64; Windows ARM64 is not certified. macOS-only `dsh-restart` is excluded from source/catalog/install choices. PowerShell commands use `python` without Bash line continuations.

## Install and launch

Install matching-architecture DeepSeek Harness, Node.js 24, Python 3.10+ and pnpm separately. Package pins come from a snapshot of host components 0.2.1-rc.4; check plugin compatibility on other host releases.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/johnnyliu1126/deepseek-harness-plugins-windows.git
cd deepseek-harness-plugins-windows
python scripts/platform_support.py --check-node

# Preview only / 只读预览
python scripts/collection.py --target "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\collection-windows" --all

# Apply and fetch / 新建 Profile 并安装
python scripts/collection.py --target "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\collection-windows" --all --apply --fetch
```

Existing targets are refused. The installer does not overwrite desktop, copy credentials or restart the app. For only local plugins:

```powershell
python scripts/collection.py --target "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\collection-windows-local" --plugins dsh-balance-monitor --apply --fetch
```

A new profile does not switch Desktop automatically. With a matching host CLI, inspect its configuration before explicitly launching:

```sh
dsh --profile collection-windows --dump-config
dsh --profile collection-windows --help
dsh --profile collection-windows
```

Check ports before starting another instance. Configure the host CLI if dsh is absent; do not copy another OS’s application path. See the [install guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

The aggregate includes seven Web UI children. Avoid selecting both an aggregate and its child. Four compatibility guards stay disabled: task board, pet, image description and skin center. Mobile has a known React peer mismatch (^19.3.0 requested versus 18.3.1 in the original isolated graph), so mobile UI compatibility is not certified.

## Platform-specific differences

Upstream mobile docs list LAN/cloudflared/FRP/own proxy plus Windows x64 Funnel/cpolar/Caddy/experimental iroh, each with account/network/native-component prerequisites. Modern Chrome/Edge login import should use the extension bridge rather than an ABE-blocked profile-copy route.

## Feature details

### Diagnostics, rules and patch management — `dsh-purge-community`

- Status diagnostics: inspect patch and host evidence; a read failure is not an absent installation.
- Prompt and rule management: per-preset text, ordering, exclusions, and one-shot injection controls.
- Patch lifecycle: local backups, apply/revert and version management; host modification requires an explicit separate action.
- Lab workbench: packaged presets, skills, SQLite evidence store and /redteam/api bridge.
- Retry/continue: configurable retry limits and continuation text; success is not guaranteed.

**Use:** Open the plugin sidebar, inspect diagnostics/backups, then manage preset prompts/rules or revert changes.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-purge-community/README.md).

### Web UI aggregate — `@neystan/dsh-web-ui-all`

- Aggregate installation: task board, Git graph, side panel, pet, image description and skins.
- Composition: a bundle patch mounts child plugins; install individual packages for a subset.
- Compatibility: some settings require newer keyed slots; four child rows are disabled in the observed profile.

**Use:** Install the aggregate and use its board, Git graph and file-panel entries; four compatibility-limited children remain disabled.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/neystan--dsh-web-ui-all/README.md).

### Feishu / Lark bot — `dsh-lark-channel`

- Chat-driven agents: Feishu/Lark messages launch host tasks with separate reasoning/tool/result views.
- Durable sessions: chat/thread/sender scopes, /new reset and /sessions continuation.
- Workspace/model controls: /ws, /cd, /model, /status and /stop.
- Interactive cards: questions, plan reviews and tool approvals subject to configured approvers.
- Multiple bots: separate credentials/sessions, botPeers allowlists and botHops loop bounds.
- File transfer: workspace inbox and per-send group approval, with a default 20 MiB per-file limit.

**Use:** Provision a Feishu/Lark bot with local credentials, then send it tasks; use /status, /ws, /cd, /model and /sessions.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-lark-channel/README.md).

### Architecture diagrams — `@tt-a1i/archify-dsh`

- Architecture skill: exposes Archify via a filesystem skill provider; invoke it by name.
- Structured artifacts: specification JSON and HTML diagrams with components, a main path and trust boundaries.
- Lightweight adapter: no extra native tools or Web UI; bundles Archify 3.0.1 independently of adapter version.

**Use:** Ask: “Use the archify skill to analyze this repository, generate architecture JSON and HTML, and return their file paths.”

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/tt-a1i--archify-dsh/README.md).

### Prompt optimization — `dsh-prompt-enhancer`

- Draft optimization: a composer button rewrites the draft before sending, with edit/undo opportunities.
- Instruction modes: concise, balanced (default), detailed and custom, with a short-chat over-expansion retry.
- Model routing: shared free channel, current model or fixed model; fallback may consume paid conversation quota.
- Diagnostics: settings test the channel and show the last actual route; settings are stored locally.

**Use:** Write a draft, click Optimize, review it, then send; settings offer concise, balanced, detailed and custom modes.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-prompt-enhancer/README.md).

### Vision and OCR — `@liustack/modlens`

- Image understanding: OCR, reading order, regions, entities and relationships for text-only models.
- Providers: Gemini, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Antigravity, Claude and Kimi CLI backends.
- Failover/key rotation: authorization, rate-limit and quota failures can rotate keys or switch providers.
- CLI reuse: doctor discovers installed tools; explicitly configured reuse may consume their subscription quota.

**Use:** Configure a vision provider, then ask: “Read this image, transcribe all text and explain the chart.” Diagnose with modlens doctor.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/liustack--modlens/README.md).

### Web and X search — `@liustack/modsearch`

- Web search/fetch: search and page text for models without native web access.
- Engines: Firecrawl, Keenable, You.com, Antigravity, Tavily, Exa and local fetch.
- X search: available through a configured, authenticated Grok Build installation.
- Fallback/key rotation: switch failed channels; advertised free quotas are upstream claims and may change.

**Use:** Ask for search/fetch, e.g. “Search this technical question and include source links.” X search additionally needs configured Grok Build.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/liustack--modsearch/README.md).

### Browser automation — `dsh-ego-browser`

- Browser tools: ego_* tools drive the bundled ego-lite runtime for navigation and interaction.
- Live panel: SSE screencast, direct mouse control, tabs, download capture and human-verification notices.
- Login import: Chrome/Edge bridge or non-destructive profile copies; login data is excluded here.
- Host variants: Web side panel, optional TUI text UI and tools-only headless use.

**Use:** Ask the agent to navigate/interact and watch the side panel; use the plugin login-import flow or sign in manually when needed.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-ego-browser/README.md).

### Reasoning slider and skin — `dsh-client-liang-intensity-skin`

- Reasoning slider: maps the model’s actual reasoning.efforts evenly to 0–30.
- Commit behavior: drag previews; release, keyboard completion or blur snaps and commits the original effort ID.
- Visibility: hidden for unsupported/single-effort models and addressed subagents.
- Appearance: themed mode adds characters/background/colors; native mode restores the host UI.

**Use:** Enable the skin, select a model with multiple reasoning efforts, then drag and release the slider to commit a level.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-client-liang-intensity-skin/README.md).

### Balance monitor — `dsh-balance-monitor`

- Balances: query host deepseekAccount; show recharge, bonus and total per currency.
- Refresh: 60-second default, 30/60/120/300 options, manual refresh, request merging and a 3-second throttle.
- Alert: default threshold 10 highlights low balances; settings persist in localStorage.
- Timing: Beijing-time workday windows/countdown with hardcoded 2026 holidays; not an official live pricing feed.
- Failure states: signed out, unsupported and failed are distinct; failures do not display zero balances.

**Use:** Sign in through the host DeepSeek account UI and open a session; view the balance below the composer and click it for polling/threshold settings.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-balance-monitor/README.md).

### Mobile access — `dsh-mobile`

- Mobile sessions: shared workspaces/messages/tools with touch-oriented composer, drawer and question cards.
- Clients: Android application and mobile browser/PWA, with customizable UI and device lists.
- Pairing: QR/link/key setup, multi-device reachability, switching, re-pairing and local-record removal.
- Networking: LAN, Tailscale, cpolar, Cloudflare, FRP, own proxy and Caddy; iroh is experimental and platform-limited.
- Notifications: iOS Home Screen Web Push and Android native alerts require explicit opt-in.
- Diagnostics/security: redacted connection reports, device credentials, Origin binding and per-path third-party WebSocket approvals.

**Use:** Choose LAN or a remote transport in mobile-access settings and pair by QR; configure accounts, tunnels and notifications locally.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/dsh-mobile/README.md).

### Task board, cron and todos — `@neystan/dsh-client-ui-task-board`

- Task board: multi-column cards, host persistence and execution through real agent sessions.
- Scheduling: host cron with create/list/pause/resume/run/delete actions.
- Todos: add/list/complete/delete with durable storage.

**Use:** On a compatible host, open the board, add tasks/todos and configure cron for scheduled runs. Disabled by the current template.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/neystan--dsh-client-ui-task-board/README.md).

### File tree and multi-tab preview — `@neystan/dsh-client-ui-aionui-panel`

- Explorer: workspace file tree, filename search and Git changes.
- Preview: multi-tab viewing for over ten formats using host fs/git services.

**Use:** Open the right panel to browse the workspace tree, search filenames, inspect Git changes and open preview tabs.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/neystan--dsh-client-ui-aionui-panel/README.md).

### Git graph and branches — `@neystan/dsh-client-ui-git-graph`

- Branches/graph: a branch selector and commit graph in the session header.
- Git operations: host-side branch creation/switching with guards.

**Use:** Use the session-header Git graph to inspect/select/create/switch repository branches; operations affect the real repository.

[Configuration, provenance, permissions and limits](catalog/neystan--dsh-client-ui-git-graph/README.md).

### Companion interactions — `@neystan/dsh-pet`

- Activity animation: nine states driven by session/tool events.
